        "Question": "A human resources department deploys a generative AI (gen AI) model to screen job applications and provide a shortlist of candidates to recruiters. Recruiters notice that some seemingly qualified candidates are consistently being overlooked, but the AI provides no explanation for its rankings or exclusions. The company needs to address this lack of transparency. What should they do?",
        "Possible answers": "A)Collect a larger and more diverse dataset for the gen AI model.\nB)Fine-tune the gen AI model.\nC)Implement explainable gen AI policies.\nD)Develop fairness assessments for the gen AI model.",
        "Correct answer & Explanation": "Correct Answer:\nC\n\nExplanation:\nA is incorrect because, while a larger and more diverse dataset could potentially improve the model's accuracy and reduce bias, it does not inherently make the model's screening process transparent. Recruiters would still lack insight into why certain candidates are being shortlisted over others. While data quality is essential for ethical AI, it doesn't automatically provide explainability.\n\nB is incorrect because fine-tuning aims to optimize the model's performance on the screening task, but it doesn't necessarily reveal how the model is making its choices. Even if the shortlist improves after fine-tuning, the lack of transparency regarding the selection criteria remains. Fine-tuning focuses on improving task-specific performance, not on making the model's reasoning understandable.\n\nC is correct because it directly tackles the issue of unclear decision-making. Implementing explainable gen AI techniques would allow the HR department and recruiters to understand the factors that the AI model is using to rank and exclude candidates. This aligns with the principle that transparency is paramount for ethical applications and that users need to understand how AI systems make decisions. Explainable AI makes the decision-making processes of AI models transparent and understandable, which is crucial for building trust and identifying potential issues.\n\nD is incorrect because, while developing fairness assessments is important for ensuring the AI model is not discriminatory in its candidate selection, it does not directly address the need to understand why the model is making specific decisions. Assessing for fairness helps identify potential biases, but it doesn't explain the reasoning behind individual candidate rankings or exclusions."

        "Question": "A company is evaluating the use of large language models (LLMs) to enhance its operations and customer interactions. What is a primary characteristic of LLMs?",
        "Possible answers": "A)LLMs excel in highly specific technical tasks requiring deep, singular domain expertise.\nB)LLMs learn and generalize effectively from small datasets for niche applications.\nC)LLMs have strong inherent logical reasoning and problem-solving abilities without extra prompting.\nD)LLMs are trained on vast datasets, enabling broad language and context understanding, and adaptability across many tasks.",
        "Correct answer & Explanation": "Correct Answer:\nD\n\nExplanation:\nA is incorrect because, while LLMs can be applied to specific tasks, their core strength lies in their general language understanding derived from broad training, enabling them to handle a variety of applications rather than being limited to highly specialized areas.\n\nB is incorrect because LLMs are known for requiring vast amounts of data for effective training to achieve their broad capabilities. They are not typically effective with limited datasets without fine-tuning on more specific data.\n\nC is incorrect because, while LLMs can exhibit reasoning capabilities, this often requires effective prompt engineering or advanced techniques like chain-of-thought prompting. They do not inherently possess strong logical reasoning without guidance. Additionally, limitations such as \"hallucinations,\" indicating they are not flawless problem-solvers.\n\nD is correct because foundation models, including LLMs, are trained on massive amounts of diverse data (text, images, and code). This broad training allows them to develop a deep understanding of the data and be adapted to many different tasks. The flexibility of foundation models, including LLMs, to support a wide range of use cases stems directly from this training on diverse data."

        "Question": "An AI robot learns optimal package delivery routes in a city. It receives positive scores for fast, successful deliveries and negative scores for delays or failures. Through this feedback, the robot improves its navigation over time. What type of machine learning is being used to train the robot?",
        "Possible answers": "A)Supervised learning\nB)Deep learning\nC)Unsupervised learning\nD)Reinforcement learning",
        "Correct answer & Explanation": "Correct Answer:\nD\n\nExplanation:\nA is incorrect because supervised learning requires labeled data, where each input is paired with a correct output. This scenario does not involve pre-labeled optimal routes; the robot learns through trial and error.\n\nB is incorrect because, while deep learning can be a component of reinforcement learning, it is not the overarching learning paradigm described. Deep learning refers to neural networks with multiple layers. Deep learning can be used to implement the function that learns the optimal policy in reinforcement learning. However, the learning process itself is defined by the reward and penalty mechanism.\n\nC is incorrect because unsupervised learning focuses on finding patterns in unlabeled data without specific goals or feedback. The robot's learning is goal-oriented (optimizing delivery routes) and driven by the feedback it receives.\n\nD is correct because the robot learns through interaction with its environment and by receiving rewards (positive scores) and penalties (negative scores) for its actions. That is the fundamental process of reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning is all about learning through interaction and feedback, where an algorithm learns to maximize rewards and minimize penalties by interacting with its environment."

        "Question": "A company wants to use generative AI (gen AI) to automate complex workflows and improve decision-making across its various departments. They are considering implementing AI agents as a key component of their strategy. What is the primary function of an AI agent in a gen AI system?",
        "Possible answers": "A)To provide the computing power for training and running advanced AI models.\nB)To be the user interface for interacting with AI models.\nC)To be a smart system that can analyze, use tools, and make decisions to reach goals.\nD)To be a central storage place for the data that AI models use.",
        "Correct answer & Explanation": "Correct Answer:\nC\n\nExplanation:\nA is incorrect because, while infrastructure is crucial for AI, its primary function is to provide the foundational computing resources, not to act as the intelligent decision-making component of an agent.\n\nB is incorrect because, while platforms like Vertex AI Studio offer interfaces for interacting with models, the primary function of an agent is the autonomous reasoning and action, not just the user interface. Agents use models, but they are more than just an interface.\n\nC is correct because AI agents are defined as entities that observe, act, and achieve goals by incorporating a reasoning loop and tools. A gen AI agent is an application that tries to achieve a goal by observing the world and acting upon it using the tools it has at its disposal. This highlights their ability to analyze situations and make decisions to fulfill objectives without constant human oversight. They leverage tools to interact with their environment and perform actions.\n\nD is incorrect because, while data storage is essential for AI, it is a separate function from the agent's ability to process information, reason, and take actions. Agents utilize data stores as tools, but their core function is not data management itself."

        "Question": "A business analyst asks a generative AI model about the quarterly revenue of a small startup that recently entered the market. The model confidently provides a specific revenue figure and even mentions a supposed press release detailing the company's success. However, after further investigation, the analyst discovers that the startup has not yet released any financial reports, and no such press release exists. The information provided by the AI model is entirely fabricated despite sounding plausible. Which type of large language model limitation does this exemplify?",
        "Possible answers": "A)Bias\nB)Knowledge cutoff\nC)Data dependency\nD)Hallucinations",
        "Correct answer & Explanation": "Correct Answer:\nD\n\nExplanation:\nA is incorrect because bias refers to the model's tendency to produce outputs that reflect imbalances or prejudices present in its training data, not necessarily the fabrication of entirely new information.\n\nB is incorrect because knowledge cutoff refers to the point in time after which the model has not been trained on new information. While this can lead to an inability to answer questions about recent events, in this scenario, the model is generating non-existent information rather than stating it doesn't know or providing outdated information.\n\nC is incorrect because data dependency highlights that the performance of foundation models relies heavily on the quality and completeness of their training data. While a lack of specific data might lead to an inability to answer, hallucinations involve generating factually incorrect or nonsensical responses, even if the model believes it has the information.\n\nD is correct because hallucinations occur when foundation models produce outputs that are not accurate or based on real information. In this scenario, the AI model fabricates revenue data and a press release that does not exist, which is a clear example of a hallucination. The model cannot verify information against external sources and may generate convincing but incorrect responses."

It's raw, unprocessed information without inherent meaning. The emails in the stem have been processed and assigned categories, thus they are not unlabeled.\n\nB is correct because these categories; Billing Inquiry, Technical Support, or Feature Request; function as labels, which assigns meaning to each email by providing a corresponding output. This pairing of input (email) and output (label) defines labeled data, which is crucial for supervised machine learning models that learn from such input-output pairs.\n\nC is incorrect because structured data has information neatly arranged in tables and is easy to search and find. Examples include online shopping orders or bank statements. While the email categories might be considered structured information, the content of the emails themselves (the text) is likely unstructured data as it lacks a predefined format and isn't easily organized into rows and columns\n\nD is incorrect because raw data refers to data that has not been processed or formatted for use.

The platform offers different levels of technical input, from no-code/low-code to full code development, indicating that while some solutions require minimal technical knowledge, they are not universally \"fully automated requiring no technical input.\"\nOption C is correct because Google Cloud's AI platform democratizes AI development by offering low-code/no-code tools such as Vertex AI AutoML, access to a wide range of pre-trained models in Model Garden, and user-friendly APIs. This comprehensive approach empowers individuals with different technical backgrounds to leverage AI without needing deep machine learning expertise.\nD is incorrect because this describes an unsustainable business model and circumvents the need for users to use the platform to build their own solutions, which is a core aspect of democratizing AI."

        "Question": "A marketing team is brainstorming creative ideas for a new social media campaign. They want to quickly generate various taglines and initial post drafts to explore different angles and messaging options. They need a Google Cloud prebuilt generative AI tool without additional setup that allows for rapid content creation and experimentation. What should the team do?",
        "Possible answers": "A)Use NotebookLM to upload past successful campaigns and analyze their key elements.\nB)Use Gemini for Google Workspace within Google Slides to prepare a presentation outlining their social media campaign strategy.\nC)Use the Gemini app to create taglines and social media post drafts that align with their campaign goals and target audience.\nD)Create a custom Gem in Gemini Advanced with specific brand guidelines and target audience profiles.",
        "Correct answer & Explanation": "Correct Answer:\nC\n\nExplanation:\nA is incorrect because NotebookLM is primarily for analyzing uploaded documents and extracting insights, not for rapid, open-ended creative content generation for social media.\nB is incorrect because while Gemini for Google Workspace can help refine and present content, it is not the primary tool for initial, rapid generation of multiple creative taglines and post drafts.\nC is correct because the Gemini app is designed for direct interaction and content generation through prompting. The marketing team can quickly input their campaign goals and target audience details and ask Gemini to generate multiple tagline options and initial post drafts for rapid brainstorming and exploration.\nD is incorrect because while creating a custom Gem can ensure brand consistency, it requires more setup and is less suited for the initial, exploratory phase of generating a wide range of creative ideas quickly. The Gemini app offers a more immediate solution for this purpose."
